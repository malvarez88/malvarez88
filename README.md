### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I'M MARIANO ALVAREZ, I started my career as a developer relatively recently, although I've always been interested in programming, I'm waiting to start working and improve my skills.
I am a full stack developer, with strong bases in React & React Native.
I also know Node, Express, Sequelize, SQL.

I really want to learn and keep improving as a programmer.
